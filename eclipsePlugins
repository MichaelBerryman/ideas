Keyboard Shortcut suggestor
record which shortcuts people use and their frequency (nothing identifiable) (may already be supported by feedback diagnostics or similar)

if a user is not using a "popular" shortcut then, occasionally suggest that it might be useful

? how to tell if the shortcut is applicable to them?  feedback on the suggestion pop up - not applicable to me, thanks, no thanks, go away etc

create heatmaps of keyboard shortcuts to suggest changing the shortcut to make it easier, e.g. if they're using a chain, suggest making the resultant action a first class shortcut
