- Keyboard Shortcut suggestor
record which shortcuts people use and their frequency (nothing identifiable) (may already be supported by feedback diagnostics or similar)

if a user is not using a "popular" shortcut then, occasionally suggest that it might be useful

? how to tell if the shortcut is applicable to them?  feedback on the suggestion pop up - not applicable to me, thanks, no thanks, go away etc

create heatmaps of keyboard shortcuts to suggest changing the shortcut to make it easier, e.g. if they're using a chain, suggest making the resultant action a first class shortcut

- Ghost Writer
Assume that people will want to refactor a used variable and always retype usages inline with the edits being made

- Ghost Text
Enrich rows of code with knowledge, this will not affect running of the code, probably not even selectable (might be useful to be able to copy it though)

e.g. 
  regex - use an existing regex explainer to add a ghost text explanation of any regex found
  api hints - note types or variable names so you don't have to navigate a new API to figure out what to pass around
