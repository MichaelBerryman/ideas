Feature request - pass through of keyboard shortcut

specific example - shortcut for global search in apple notes is cmd + opt + f - which conflicts with spectacles make full screen

therefore provide an option  preference for passthrough, which would invoke the keypress again after it's been intercepted by spectacle in case someone else is using it...

notes shorcut is not reassignable

other thoughts - only passthrough if the function is not applicable for the current scenario, e.g. 

notes is not full screen - c + o + f make it full screen

notes is already full screen - c+ o + f passes through spectacle to notes and invokes global search

could also only perform it on repeated invocations, e.g. if already full screen and cmd invoked twice then pass through, although I doubt that there's any state in spectacle
