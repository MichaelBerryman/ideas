laser cutters and engravers e.g. glowforge are essentially a printer head with a laser

add a tradtional printer head to it and you'd be able to create coloured designs and cut them out in one pass

think of designing a web page layout, imagine being able to print out the current layout, then cut around it, so you could layout the redesign with existing assets

think printing pop up greeting cards with full colour designs on them in one pass
