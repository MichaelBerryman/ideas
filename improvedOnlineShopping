looking up a recipe is a very static activity

mvp find a lasagne on bbc good food, and provide scaling options
    I want to make a meal for 2, or for 15, weights should adjust accordingly
    
v2 integrate with online shops, so you can order the recipe

v3 order multiples. so you can create a meal plan for the week and order it via tesco or similar
