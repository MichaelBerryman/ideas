source of inspiration - old Dawn of War 2 mod called grid keys, which mapped all keyboard shortcuts to the same grid area of keys

first ability = q, second = w etc

this approach might work well with e.g. Eclipse, Slack

left side of the keyboard for actions on the left side of the screen, right side for actions on the right 

slack:
right hand actions might be thread related, e.g. open thread, cycle different threads etc

left hand side might be stuff for managing workspaces and conversations

eclipse:
left hand side might be file structure navigation, right hand might be code navigation 

eclipse would be a good place to start as it can count which shortcuts you use
