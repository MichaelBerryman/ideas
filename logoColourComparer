Comparing a logo against different backgrounds automatically would help identify early design issues like poor contrast in dark themes or similar

take a logo file, png etc

display it infront of a gif of different background colours

scrubbable gif or mp4 etc might be nicer

learn how colour palettes work - support different scheming so people can load a specific scheme for comparison - probably a json list of css attributes or similar

perhaps show a two colour comparison slider akin to https://squoosh.app/
