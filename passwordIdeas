as with submitting credit card numbers - submitting my real password seems such a daft idea

to mitigate the idea of a false pop up - password should be essentially one time use - in the same vein as apple pay
  as i understand apple pay - it generates and submits a fake credit card each time 
  passwords such as apps requiring elevated install priveleges should get a single use password token so that they can't store your password for later use
  note this doesn't mitigate the app stealing your main password and using that as many times as it wants
